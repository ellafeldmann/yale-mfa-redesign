            <p>
              Students are admitted to Yale’s MFA for the Fall semester of each
              year only. Applicants are notified of the admission committee’s
              decisions on preliminary selections in early February, and final
              decisions in early March. No information about decisions will be
              given over the phone. To apply for more than one area of
              concentration, separate applications, fees, and supporting
              documentation must be submitted. The work submitted should be
              representative of the applicant’s experience in that particular
              field. Applicants should be advised that applying to more than one
              program does not increase chances of selection.

              Open House will be live-streamed and may be attended virtually on
              November 14th, Noon-4pm Doors at 11:30am. The Yale School of Art

              (sorry, we cannot accommodate guests/companions) and event details
              will be sent to the email address used to register.Note that the
              School of Art will NOT conduct individual interviews or provide

            <h1 class="section-title">Entrance Requirements</h1>
            <p>
              The School of Art requires for admission a high degree of
              capability and commitment. Applicants must hold a bachelor’s
              degree from an accredited college or university or a diploma from
              a four-year accredited professional art school. In exceptional
              cases and most particularly in light of the differences among
              educational structures and opportunities in the international art
              world today, the admissions committee may waive these
              prerequisites if other proofs of preparation and accomplishment
              are deemed sufficient equivalents by the committee. In either
              case, admission to the School of Art is on a highly selective and
              competitive basis.
            </p>
            <h4 class="subtitle">Application Materials</h4>
            <p>
              Nonrefundable application fee of $100. Please follow payment
              instructions at https://apply.art.yale.edu/apply/. Forms of
              payment include credit card and checking account. Yale School of
              Art, in our commitment to equity and access, practices “need blind
              admission”; meaning that, candidate financial need or ability is
              never disclosed to the admission committee during review of MFA
              applications. For this reason, and because the processing and
              careful review of each individual application demands great time
              and human resources, we regret that the School does not waive the
              application fee under any circumstances.

              <p>
                A statement that addresses inﬂuences, interests, current work
                direction, brief life history (as it relates to art/design
                practice), and reasons for applying to graduate school at this
                time. Statements should be limited to one page or no more than
                500 words. Applicants to the Painting/Printmaking program should
                make reference in their statements to the “representative work”
                in the portfolio; this is not critical for the other programs.

                References from three persons practicing or teaching in the
                field in which application is made, attesting to the applicant’s
                ability and competence in that field. The admissions committee
                reviews applications shortly after the deadline. While it is not
                uncommon for letters of recommendation to come in past the
                January 10th deadline, please impress upon on those who will be
                writing on your behalf, that late submission of supporting
                documentation may risk exclusion from the review. Applicants can
                always view the receipt status of reference requests on the
                application status page.

                Transcripts of academic record for the bachelor’s degree and/or

                invited to interview. If invited to interview, official
                transcripts should be mailed to: Yale School of Art Admissions,
                POB 208339, New Haven, CT 06520-8339. Neither junior college
                transcripts nor Graduate Record Examination (GRE) scores are

              <p>
                Applicants who fail to upload a portfolio as outlined by the
                stated deadline will NOT be considered. The portfolio should
                represent images of your best work, indicate your current
                direction, and demonstrate your ability. At least half of the
                images should represent work done within the last twelve months,
                and all should be from within the last three years.
                Chronological order of year is embedded in our system, and you
                will not be able to override it. The application system used by
                Yale requires that one image from the portfolio be designated as
                a “representative work.” This selection is simply the default
                image for the cover page of each application file. As such,
                applicants have historically selected the piece which most
                strongly represents ideas central to their current body of work.
              </p>
              <p>
                Do not include more than one image on the screen, nor embed
                other pages of a publication or video within the images you
                place in your portfolio. Do not include detail photos of work in
                your portfolio unless you consider them absolutely necessary.
                Under no circumstances should more than two detail shots be
                included. Portfolio requirements differ depending upon area of
                concentration; be sure to follow the instructions for the area
                to which you are applying. We strongly recommend that you review
                your images on a Mac OS to be certain that they are accurately
                represented.
